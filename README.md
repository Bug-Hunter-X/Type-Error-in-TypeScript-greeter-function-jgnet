This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and provides a solution. The `bug.ts` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.ts` offers a corrected version. The error arises from attempting to pass an array to a function expecting a string. The solution involves type checking to ensure the input is a string or handling the array appropriately.  This example is useful for understanding type safety in TypeScript and how to effectively handle type mismatches.
